<h2>Jendri injections</h2>
<p>
    If you know that your service, widget or page will always use a service, you can say Jendri to preload it by putting
    it's name or tag onto one of the fields of your <a href="docs/environment">environment object</a>:
</p>
<pre>
    me.less = 'less';
</pre>
<p>
    If any of required for your module services will fail, Jendri will trigger the 'depfail' event on your
    environment object. You can control the service loading mechanism by putting these prefixes before
    the required service name:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>$ — to signal Jendri that it shouldn't wait until the service will register itself because this service is not
    compatible with Jendri. In this case Jendri will try to register the global object with the same name as the required
    service and pass this object to your module.</li>
    <li>
        ~ — to signal Jendri that this service is optional and it should not stop load your module and emit the 'depfail'
        event even if the service will fail to load.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After all of the requested services are loaded, Jendri will emit the 'start' or 'create' event on your module
    (depends on type of your module).
</p>
<p>
    To make your life easier, Jendri automatically injects itself into the field "me.jendri" of your environment object.
