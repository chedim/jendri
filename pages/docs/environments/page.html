<h2>Jendri environments</h2>
<p>
    Every module that loaded by Jendri, runs in it's own closure that we call 'environment'. Environments are
    usually represented by three predefined objects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>me</b> — the "process" object that contains a link to the closure of your module code.
        This object is used for dependency injections and to emit service events; This object is public and can be
        accessed by other modules.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>c</b> — the html-container object. Inaccessible in services. Pages and widgets should not make any DOM
        manipulations anywhere except for this object and it's contents. Used for emitting lifecycle events in
        pages and widgets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>$</b> — the JQuery object, linked to the html-container object, so you can use $ function and not be concerned
        about modifying contents outside of your html-container.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can obtain the process object by calling the "procces" jquery plugin on a widget html-container:
</p>
<pre>
    var widget_process = $(widget_container).process();
    // widget_process now contains the process object of a widget.
</pre>
