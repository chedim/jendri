<h1>Welcome to Jendri documentation website</h1>

<p>
    Jendri is an "operation system" for your websites that allows you to develop them and reuse your code much more
    easily. Using Jendri, you can split your front-end code to a small pieces which we call widgets, pages, interfaces,
    and services. It takes care about all of your needs, providing you:
<nobr>It takes care</nobr> about all of your needs, providing you:
<ul>
    <li>Ability to reuse your code through widgets</li>
    <li>Automatic dependency injection</li>
    <li>Automatic URL routing</li>
    <li>On-demand built-in libraries: jquery, less, async, debug console, chart.js</li>
    <li>Production client-side html, javascript code and css styles caching based on IndexedDB</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Quick Start — loading Jendri</h2>
<p>
    To load Jendri, you should include two scripts on your page:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;script type="application/javascript" src="/lib/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script>
    &lt;script type="application/javascript" src="/services/jendri.js"></script>
</pre>
<p>
    Of course, you can replace jquery-2.1.1.min.js with any compatible jquery version.
</p>

<h2>Quick Start — widgets</h2>
<p>
    The main concept of Jendri is to split website pages into small reusable parts, called widgets. Every widget
    contains three files:
    one for it's html-view, one for it's stylesheet and one for it's javascript code. These files are called page.html,
    style.css (or style.css if LESS library is provided) and code.js. In favor of simplicity, Jendri doesn't provide
    any template engine, so all of your html manipulations should be done in your javascript code.
</p>
<p>
    Usage of widgets is pretty simple: just add a "widget" attribute to the element where you want to place your widget.
    In example, to use the time picker widget you should make something like this:
</p>
<div class="openable">
    <a href="javascript:void(0)">&lt;div widget="picker/time"/></a> (click the code to see the result)
    <font class="hidden">
        <div widget="picker/time"/>
    </font>
</div>
<p>
    It worth to mention that this plugin also requires some js-libraries for working, so Jendri automatically loaded
    them
    before it started the widget. Every widget runs in it's own environment, so you can embed as many widgets as you
    want.
    Even more: you can reuse widgets inside any other widget, like the time interval picking widget does:
</p>
<div widget="picker/time/interval" style="position: relative; display: inline-block"/>
<p>
    Cool, yeah? :)

<h2>Quick start — pages</h2>
<p>
    Pages are widgets that represent some different type of content (or, in case of this site, different content
    itself).
    Every page has it's own address that can be entered by user on his web-browser's address bar. Matching between
    addresses
    and pages in Jendri executed via router service and called routing. Routing algorithm is actually pretty simple:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the anchor part of current webpage url, use it as a page location base</li>
    <li>If the anchor part is empty, use the configuration variable "home"</li>
    <li>Prepend the page location base with the "source" configuration value and "/page/" prefix</li>
    <li>Try to load widget from the resulting address</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>

<H2>Quick start — services</H2>
<p>
    Services are js-libraries, that you can use with Jendri. Our service loading algorithm was designed to support any
    library that you probably will be needed. To add a new library, simply place it under the "library" directory. To
    mention
    any library as dependency, add it's filename without extension as a value of any string field of your widget, page
    or library environment:
</p>
<pre>
    this.datejs = 'datejs';
    // or:
    me.datejs = 'datejs';
</pre>
<p>
    If you are trying to load library that wasn't designed to work with Jendry, simply prefix it with a dollar sign.
    Please note,
    that in this case you should name the library file exactly as it's global (window) variable named. In example:
</p>
<pre>
    me.async = '$async';
</pre>
<p>
    If one of the libraries is optional, you can prefix it with a tilda sign:
</p>
<pre>
    me.appcache = '~appcache';
    me.less = '~$less';
</pre>
<p>
    Please note, that the tilda sign always should lead to any other prefixes.
</p>

</p>
<h2>Quick start — interfaces</h2>
<p>
    To use the same page in different environments you can use interfaces. Interfaces are made as container widgets for
    pages.
    When the router service tries to load a page, it will place it inside of the element of current interface that has a
    "content" id.
</p>
<p>
    You can use interfaces, in example, to provide different site layouts for different types of users.

<H2>Caching</H2>
<p>
    After reading this article you may ask: "And what about perfomance? It seems that this library splits a website into
    a huge amount of small files, shouldn't it increase page loading time and overload my server?". You're almost right
    except for one thing:
    Jendri has integrated application cache library that automatically stores contents of your widgets and services at a
    client's web browser,
    so actually it makes your website load and work much more faster and slightly decreases overload of your server! And
    this library supports
    versioning of your website, so you can be always sure that your visitors will always get the latest version!
