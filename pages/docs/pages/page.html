<h1>Jendri pages</h1>
<p>
    Jendri pages are almost the same as <a href="docs/widgets">widgets</a>, except for several moments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        At any moment there can be only one page running
    </li>
    <li>
        The running page is determined by the current url value
    </li>
    <li>
        All pages are located under the "page" directory
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To call a page, at your browser address bar append the pound sign and the page address (relative to the "pages" directory):
</p>
<pre>
    http://yourwebsite.com/#article
    http://yourwebsite.com/#register
</pre>
<p>
    You can pass some arguments to the page that you want to load:
</p>
<pre>
    http://yourwebsite.com/#article?id=97465
    http://yourwebsite.com/#register?role=admin
</pre>
<p>
    If you will change arguments inside of the address bar, loaded page will get the "arguments" event as described
    on the "<a href="#docs/widgets">widgets page</a>
</p>
<p>
    To load any page from your code, use the 'router.navigate' function or any other url changing method:
</p>
<pre>
    me.router = 'router';
    $(c).on('resume', function() {
        me.router.navigate('profile');
        // or
        window.location.hash = 'profile';
    }
</pre>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>
    Interfaces wrap any loaded page and provide some useful and static website elements: menu, sidebars, etc. Technically
    interfaces realization is the same as widgets and pages, but you can't embed them or call them from the browser address
    bar. All interfaces are located under the 'interfaces' directory.
</p>
<p>To change current interface, use the "router.setUI" method:</p>
<pre>
    me.router = 'router';
    $(c).on('resume', function() {
        if (window.user) {
            if (window.user.admin) {
                Router.setUI('admin');
            } else {
                Router.setUI('user');
            }
        } else {
            Router.setUI('guest');
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    It's always a better idea to have a separate website for your admin-panel ;-)
