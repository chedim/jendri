<h2>Jendri widgets</h2>
<p>
    Widgets in Jendri are the main website building blocks. Usually they responsible of the contents, look and behavior
    of their html-container contents, so they consist of three files:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        page.html — html-template, that will be injected inside of the html-container before widget will be started.
    </li>
    <li>
        style.less — less-code, that will affect how the html-container contents will look.
    </li>
    <li>
        code.js — javascript code that will create widget's behavior.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    To create a widget, create a subdirectory in the "widgets" directory and place there at least
    one of the "page.html" or "code.js" files:
</p>
<pre>
    /widgets/
        menu/
            page.html
        picker/
            date/
                code.js
                page.html
                style.less
</pre>
<p>
    To inject a widget, set the "widget" attribute of any html component to the widget address in the "widgets" directory:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;div widget="menu"/>
    &lt;div widget="picker/date"/>
</pre>

<h2>Widget lifecycle</h2>
<p>
    During the widget lifecycle, Jendri Router emits some events on it's html-container element:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        start — when the widget and all it's required dependencies had loaded
    </li>
    <li>
        resume — when the widget's html-container becomes visible and available for user
    </li>
    <li>
        pause — when the widget's html-container is no longer visible or available for user
    </li>
    <li>
        free — when the widget should be unloaded
    </li>
    <li>
        arguments — when any new arguments had been passed to the widget through it's address
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Widget arguments</h2>
<p>
    There is several ways to pass some arguments to the widget: through it's html-container, through it's address or
    through it's process object.
</p>
<h3>Html-container arguments</h3>
<p>
    First of all, when it starts, your widget can check some attributes on it's html-container. But also you can pass
    some html-code to the widget, setting it's html-container contents <b>before</b> the widget is loaded. When Jendri
    will load the widget's template file, it will append contents of the container to the "content" tag:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;-- this is an example of widget html-template that able to hold passed html-content: -->
    Hello! Your passed html content is: &lt;content/>
</pre>
<h3>Address arguments</h3>
<p>
    When you inserting a widget, you can pass some arguments to it as you pass arguments at HTTP GET-requests:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;div widget="calendar?month=september"/>
</pre>
<p>
    In this case after the Calendar widget will be loaded, Jendri will emit the 'arguments' event to the widget with
    the arguments that you declared in the widget address.
</p>
<h3>Process arguments</h3>
<p>
    Your widget can provide some interface to control it through it's process object:
</p>
<pre>
    me.setMonth = function(month) { /* ... */ };
</pre>
<p>
    To access this interface, get the widget process object and call any of widget's declared public functions:
</p>
<pre>
    $(month_widget_container).process().setMonth('september');
</pre>
